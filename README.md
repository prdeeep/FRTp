This project is a python based web app hosted on Azure cloud. Using the technologies of Azure like Webapp, Ststic Webapp. This is CRUD application i.e. you can Create, Update, Delete data.



Being from a not-tech backgroud this project helped me lot to learn new technologies like azure and coding i tried my doing this project. I would like to thank you Future Talent Ready team for providing the opportunity for a virtual internship. It was a good learning experience. I'm really lucky to be enrolled in this internship. This Internship would have been impossible without the Multiple Live Guided Session which resolved many of the queries raised by the student. Not only that, right from the beginning, every minute thing was well designed and carried out. Thank you for your support and guidance.

Project Journey :-

In this project i created a webapp for storing and managing our tasks using python, flask, html, css.
Then i pushed the code ito gitub reository with CLI.
And any update into the were committed into githup repository directly through VS Code.
After the final project was ready I used Azure services to host the webapp.
I used azure webapp service for this.
